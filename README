Notes on parsing URLs:
	I truncate anything after a '#' because that's a link to a position on a page.


When make is called, all the in/out files under the nodes are removed so that
they aren't appended to in the next run


Only works on lists of 8 machines.
The URL supplied to this crawler must match one in the config file
